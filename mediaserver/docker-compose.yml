      - /mnt/ext_hdd/rpi_Scratchdisk:/config/transcodes  # This is required only if you are transcoding your media files, transcoding is very intense on the I/O and can kill  a flash drive overtime. So using my USB 3.0 HDD as a scratch disk to handle temp transcoding writes as it is much more resilient to random read/writes. Will post a better solution in future when I try something like a Ramdisk with mergerfs.
