1. Check your current CPU frequency 

# watch -n 1 vcgencmd measure_clock arm

2. Check the current CPU Governor

# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

3. Set the governor to `Performance`

# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/cpufreq/scaling_governor

4. Verify the CPU freq again. And you should see that it is running at 1.5 GHz.
